    Chinese Chess

    Brief introduction: This was a program I wrote, alongside three other classmates, for the final project
    of CS100("Software Construction", at UCR). In this project, we built a terminal-based Chinese Chess game,
     using the strategy design pattern, in which the correct move() function is called, depending
     on which piece resides at the chosen coordinates.

        This terminal-based program allows users to play Chinese Chess directly from the command line,
        with the board graphics represented through ASCII characters. Upon starting the program,
        users are presented with three options. <br>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655104728/menu1_qsopai.png" alt="Starting Menu" class="projectSS">
        The three options are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Start new game: allows users to start playing a new game, in which all
            pieces are present and loaded into the default starting positions. </li>
            <li>Load saved game: allows users to continue playing a previously saved game,
            where pieces and coordinates are loaded in from a local .txt file. </li>
            <li>Quit: quits the program</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="projectSubtitle" id="game">
       Game Menu
    </div>
    <div class="projectParagraphs">
        Once the user chooses to either start a new game or continue a saved game, the chessboard
        will be displayed, along with an index and a user prompt.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655147531/game1_qkbssj.png" alt="Chessboard Display" class="projectSS">
        The initial prompt asks for the coordinates of the piece they wish to move. An appropriate error message will
        be displayed for the following cases:
        <ul>
            <li>Invalid coordinates: the x-value must be in range [1, 9]; the
             y-value must be in range [1, 10]</li>
            <li>Empty spot: an empty spot is chosen; there's no piece to move</li>
            <li>Wrong color: a piece of the wrong color is chosen; i.e. player red
            chooses a black piece to move</li>
        </ul>
        For example, here's the error message for the invalid coordinates:
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655147607/game2_me7sdb.png" alt="Initial Error" class="projectSS">
        Once the user inputs valid coordinates for the piece to move, they're asked to confirm
        their choice. Choosing 'n' will lead back to the initial prompt of the initial coordinates.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655150679/game3_qztqfm.png" alt="Confirm Choice" class="projectSS">
        Otherwise, if the user confirms their choice, they'll be prompted to
        enter the coordinates to move the piece to.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655150768/game4_qh5kf3.png" alt="Target Prompt" class="projectSS">
        Similar to the intial prompt, the target prompt will display an error for the following cases:
        <ul>
            <li>Invalid coordinates: the x-value must be in range [1, 9]; the
             y-value must be in range [1, 10]</li>
            <li>Invalid move: the target coordinate doesn't follow the rules of Chinese Chess;
            similar to regular Chess, each piece has a specific set of allowed moves</li>
            <li>Wrong color: a target piece of the wrong color is chosen; i.e. player red
            chooses a red piece to move to(attempting to capture their own piece)</li>
        </ul>
        The pieces of Chinese Chess adhere to the following rules:
        <ul>
            <li>General: can move one spot vertical or horizontally; however, they
            must stay within the palace on their respective side of the board(x-values
            in range [4, 6] and y-values in range [1, 3](for black general)/[8, 10]
            (for red general))</li>
            <li>Advisor: Similar to the general, they must stay inside the palace;
            they can move one spot diagonally</li>
            <li>Elephant: Can move 2 spots diagonally, but they cannot cross the river
            (strip of blank spaces between y-values 5 and 6)</li>
            <li>Horse: Move one spot horizontally/vertically, and then one spot
            diagonally outwards; they cannot jump over occupied spaces</li>
            <li>Chariot: Similar to the rook in Chess, chariots can move any number
            of spaces horizontally or vertically</li>
            <li>Pow/Cannon: They move like the chariot; however, when capturing,
             there has to be a piece(either opponent or own piece works) in between</li>
           <li>Soldier: Can only move one spot forward, until they cross the river;
           once they cross the river, they can move either horizontally or forwards, but
         they cannot move backwards</li>
        </ul>

        Assume the user attempts to move the soldier piece at (9, 7) backwards, to (9, 8).
        Recall that this is an illegal move, as soldier cannot move backwards. An error message
        will be displayed.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655153028/game5_yjlfgd.png" alt="Illegal Move" class="projectSS">
        Choosing valid coordinates for both prompts results the piece being moved to the new location. If the new location contains
        an opponents piece, that piece will be captured and removed from the chessboard. Here, the user moves the soldier piece from
        (9, 7) to (9, 6).
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655154464/game6_ndtmvh.png" alt="Valid Move" class="projectSS">
        After each player's turn, the "current turn" display at the top of the screen will be updated. The game ends when one of the player's
        general piece is captured. Assume the current game looks like so:
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655154675/game7_sp6g7c.png" alt="Checkmate Position" class="projectSS">
        Then, the player black can move their chariot at (6, 2) to capture the red general at (6, 9). A message with the winning team
        will then be displayed.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655154803/game8_zrkgfp.png" alt="Checkmate Message" class="projectSS">
        If either user chooses to quit in the middle of the game, by entering "0", they'll be prompted to save the game. Choosing "y"
         will save the coordinates of all pieces on the board to a local .txt file. The user can then continue this saved game by
          choosing the "Load saved game" option in the opening menu.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1655154938/save_u57q2j.png" alt="Save Message" class="projectSS">
