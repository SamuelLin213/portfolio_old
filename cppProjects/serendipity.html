    Brief introduction: This was a project I wrote in the summer of 2019, after taking a community college on C++(CS1B at Saddleback College).
    At the time, I was new to pointers and arrays, so struggled with the concept of building a polished program with them. In 2021, after finishing
    high school, and in preparation for college, I rewrote the program from scratch, this time finishing it, and at a much faster pace,
    after finally grasping the gist of pointers.

        This terminal-based program provides the functionalities of a cash register. Additionally, it maintains a database of books, with
        the ability to modify items. Users are presented with a menu and can input an option to navigate to other menus. Book entries
        are loaded into the database from a txt file upon execution. When the program exits, an updated database will be stored into the 
        same txt file. The database of book entries are stored in a double pointer, which stores an array of pointers.<br>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642296574/mainMenu_pnroo0.jpg" alt="Main Menu" class="projectSS">
        From the main menu, users have 4 options:
        <ul>
            <li>Cashier Module: Simulates purchasing a book, quantity of purchased books are reflected in the database</li>
            <li>Inventory Database Module: Modify the database</li>
            <li>Report Module: Lists all books in the current database, has different listing filters</li>
            <li>Exit: Quit the program, program will continue to run and display menus until this option is chosen</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="projectSubtitle" id="cashier">
       Cashier Module 
    </div>
    <div class="projectParagraphs">
        Upon entering the cashier module, users are prompted to enter the following fields:
        <ul>
            <li>Date: Today's date</li>
            <li>Quantity of Book: quantity to be purchased(this value will be subtracted from current quantity)</li>
            <li>ISBN: ISBN of book to be purchased</li>
            <li>Title: Title of book to be purchased, doesn't have to be full title</li>
            <li>Price: Retail price of book to be purchased</li>
        </ul>
        The book is searched for in the database, and if there's a match for the book with its ISBN or title, the user will be prompted
        if they want to add another book to the purchase(adds onto the same receipt).<br><br>
        However, if the book isn't found in the database, an error message will result, and user will be shown the main menu again. 
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642296574/cashier1_xkrzct.jpg" alt="Cashier Menu 1" class="projectSS">
        If the user enters 'n' to adding another book, the receipt will be displayed. Otherwise, entering 'y' will result in the program
        prompting for book info again. 
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642296574/cashier2_bpimmv.jpg" alt="Cashier Menu 2" class="projectSS">
        The receipt gives an overview of the books purchased and the final price(including a calculated tax). The "Confirm purchase?" prompt 
        will display a thank-you message alongside updating the quantity values in the database if 'y' is entered. Entering 'n' will 
        proceed to print the next "Enter another transaction" prompt without a thank-you message nor updating quantity values. 
        The "Enter another transactions" prompt will either lead back to the prompting of book info, or display the main menu again.

    <div class="projectSubtitle" id="inventory">
        Inventory Database Module
    </div>
    <div class="projectParagraphs">
        Upon choosing the inventory module, users are presented with 5 options:
        <ul>
            <li>Look up a book: search for a book in the database, if book is found its info will be displayed</li>
            <li>Add a book: Add a book entry to the database</li>
            <li>Edit a book's record: search for and edit existing entry</li>
            <li>Delete a book: search for and delete existing entry</li>
            <li>Return to main menu: goes back to the main menu</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642296778/inventoryMenu_czvmzh.jpg" alt="Inventory Menu" class="projectSS">
    </div>
    <div class="projectFunction">
        Searching for a book    
    </div>
    <div class="projectParagraphs">
        When the user chooses the search option, the program prompts for an input: either the ISBN, book title, publisher or author. All matching results
        will be printed one at a time until the user picks a desired match, or no more matchs are found(in which case a message will be printed and the naviation
        will return to the inventory module menu). 
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642296885/search1_ga0vou.jpg" alt="Search results" class="projectSS">
        Assuming we choose the second match when searching "Hobbit", then its info will be displayed, and the program won't proceed until the 
        user presses enter.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642296885/search2_me2dyy.jpg" alt="Info of book match" class="projectSS">
    </div>
    <div class="projectFunction">
        Adding a book
    </div>
    <div class="projectParagraphs">
        To add a book to the database, the current database size has to be less than value of the constant DB_SIZE, which is currently set to 125.
        If the current size is at 125, then an error message will appear, indicating that the database is full. 
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642297722/add1_luhoon.jpg" alt="Full Database" class="projectSS">
        However, in the case that our database has space, a menu will appear with values of the new item that the user can change. The pending values
        on the right will update as values are changed. An important note to remember is that the new book won't be added until the user chooses
        option 9 and saves it to the database. 
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642297722/add2_m7jnk0.jpg" alt="Add to database" class="projectSS">
        If the user types in information, but chooses option 0 before option 9, then no new book is added. 
    </div>
    <div class="projectFunction">
        Editing an existing book
    </div>
    <div class="projectParagraphs">
        Choosing the edit option calls the search function from earlier, along with displaying the maximum database size and the current size.
        Matched entries will continue displaying until all matches are printed out or the user enters 'y'. 
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642311587/edit1_iaz2ls.jpg" alt="Edit match" class="projectSS">
        Once an entry is chosen, the info of the entry will be displayed, like in the search function from before. A prompt asks the user to
        confirm their choice.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642311587/edit2_bkxzp9.jpg" alt="Edit info" class="projectSS">
        After confirming the entry is the book to be edited, the menu from add book function is shown, and users can change the value
        of the entry as they wish.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642311587/edit3_fakbzs.jpg" alt="Edit menu" class="projectSS">
    </div>
    <div class="projectFunction">
        Deleting a book
    </div>
    <div class="projectParagraphs"> 
        The delete function is extremely similar to the edit function, in that the search function is first called, and upon choosing an entry,
        its info will be displayed, along with a final confirmation. Once the book is deleted, the user will be prompted whether they
        want to delete another entry.
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dui7nse3g/image/upload/v1642312778/delete_yry259.jpg" alt="Edit menu" class="projectSS">
    </div>

    <div class="projectSubtitle" id="reports">
        Report Module
    </div>
    <div class="projectParagraphs">
        The reports module allows users to list out all book entries in the current database, and can be filtered with a few options. There are 
        six different report variations and seven total options:
        <ul>
            <li>Inventory listing: lists all info for each entry</li>
            <li>Inventory wholesale Value: Displays title, isbn, quantity and wholesale cost of entries; shows total wholesale cost of all entries at the end</li>
            <li>Inventory Retail Value: Displays title, isbn, quantity and retail cost of entries; shows total retail cost of all entries at the end</li>
            <li>Listing by Quantity: Displays title, isbn and quantity; filters entries by quantity from highest to lowest</li>
            <li>Listing by Cost: Displays title, isbn and wholesale cost; filters entries by wholesame cost from highest to lowest</li>
            <li>Listing by Age: Displays title, isbn, quantity and date added; filters entries by date added from oldest to newest</li>
            <li>Return to Main Menu: Returns navigation back to the main menu</li>
        </ul>
        Entries are displayed in pages of 10, with the report pausing every tenth entry to wait for the user to press enter.
